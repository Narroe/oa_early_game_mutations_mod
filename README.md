# oa_early_game_mutations_mod

This mod adds one building to the game; namely the "body modification clinic".

This building houses a small treasure trove of mutagens; that allows an early game character to experiment with basic mutations.
Finding the building is the easy part, getting it's treasure however...

I made this mod, so that I could play around with different (pre-threshold) mutations before they get overshadowed by other mid-game loot. 
For example: a fluffy tail is nice, but not at the cost of power armour.

Beware the other post-humans.

Feedback welcome.
